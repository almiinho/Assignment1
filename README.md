Problem1

Description: Return the minimum value of an array

Explanation:Base case n=1, then we return the first element of the array. Otherwise, we compare the arr[n-1] element with the recursive execution of the fucntion to which n=n-1 is passed and return lesser

Problem2

Description: Return the average number of an array 

Explanation: Initially sum is zerp then it pluses by the next element of an array and in the end overall sum of all elements of an array divides to the number of elements of an array and returns the average number of an array

Problem 3

Description: Checks whethers number is prime

Explanation: Checks statements when entered number is lower than 2, equal 2, divides 2 without remain to determine whether number is prime whether number is composite

Problem4

Description: Finds factorial of a number

Explanation: Checks when number is equal to 1 and returns 1. If number is not 1, then it multiplues all numbers from 1 to n to each other and returns a factorial of number

Problem 5

Description: Finds nth element of Fibinacci sequence

Explanation: Checks whether number is 0 to return 0. If not, then it pluses n-1 to n-2 and finds Fibonacci number of nth sequence

Problem 6

Description:Finds a^n

Explanation: Checks if a is equal to 0. If not, then multiplies a to each other n times.

Problem 7

Description: Return reversed array

Explanation: Checks if b equals 0. If not, then it finds the last element of an array and replace it with previous one to the first element and returns reversed array

Problem 8

Description:Checks is array all consist of digits

Explanation: Checks is first member is digit and then recurse it to others.

Problem 9

Description: Finds binomaial coefficient of 2 numbers

Explanation:Checks are numbers equal to 1 to return 1. If not, then it calls default formula of Binom coefficient to find it

Problem 10

Description: Find GCD of 2 numbers

Explanation: Checks is number equals to 0. If not, then find it with Euclidean Algorithm.
